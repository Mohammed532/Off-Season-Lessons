Pretty simple task. Really easy. I want you guys to take two int variables and make a function that adds
them together, then outputs it to the console. That's it. 

When you're done, push it to the repository, and message me on Slack. Make sure you put your code
into a folder with your name on it. Also, try to name the java file with your initials, to keep away
with duplicate file names, and make sure your class has the same name as the file. 
I'll provide an example folder of how it should look when you turn it in. Look at this example for guidance.
