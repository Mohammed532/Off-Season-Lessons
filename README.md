# Off-Season-Lessons

Welcome 6213 Coders! We'll be using this repository to learn how to code in Java, in preparation of the 2020 official FRC Games. Please follow these steps to get started.

## Instructions


### **1. Make sure you have everything downloaded**


Make sure you have the Java JDK install on your computer ([Link if you need help with that](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rzto4yY3pVw)). **PLEASE MAKE SURE YOU DOWNLOAD JDK 8. THIS IS REQUIRED!**

Also install git (Video in Slack should go over that).

### **2. Watch the videos**


Please watch the videos I assigned you (which I have posted on Slack) before continuing on. For the java playlist, you only have to watch the first 3 vidoes to begin, but please try and watch up to 5 by Tuesday, if possible. If you have any questions about the videos, message me on Slack.

### **3. Clone this repository**


If you watched the videos, you would know how to do this.

### **4. Add your name and account to Contributers List**

Go into the `README.md` file and add your name and account link to the contributers list (I'll go first as an example. Make sure you try to follow the format). You can also add a little note if you'd like.


### **5. Follow the instructions in the lesson folder**

For each lesson I tell you to do, there will be a folder, and inside, a txt file explaining what to do.

### **That's it! Happy Coding!**
